                        <p>The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.  As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.  At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required.  This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.  Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.  For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating usually result in a failing grade or mark of zero on the assignment or in the course.  Careful records are kept to monitor and prevent recidivism.
                        <br>
                        <br>    
                        A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the Universityâ€™s policies and procedures, may be found in the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0" target="_blank">Academic Calendar</a></p>

Except in the case of examination clashes and hardships (three or more formal examinations scheduled within a 24-hour period) or unforeseen events, students will be permitted to apply for out-of-time final examinations only if they are representing the University, the province, or the country in a competition or performance; serving in the Canadian military; observing a religious rite; working to support themselves or their family; or caring for a family member.  Unforeseen events include (but may not be limited to) the following: ill health or other personal challenges that arise during a term and changes in the requirements of an ongoing job.

Students should therefore note that an unofficial grade given by an instructor might be changed by the faculty, department, or school.
